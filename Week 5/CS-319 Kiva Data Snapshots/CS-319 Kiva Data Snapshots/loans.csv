866,Radka,English,"Radka and her husband Atanas have a family walnut processing business in the Roma ghetto of Sliven, Bulgaria.  Radka and Atanas have two kids, aged 10 and 14.  Atanas drives all over Bulgaria purchasing walnuts in their shells and brings them back to Sliven.  In the family’s main room, Radka, Atanas, their two sons, and a variety of cousins, aunts and uncles shell the walnuts.  Atanas then takes the nuts to one of several walnut processing companies with whom he works, which then clean and package the nuts and distribute them into grocery markets across Bulgaria.  In a two-week processing period, the family nets 250BGN (160USD).\r\n\r\nThis loan will play a crucial role in increasing the amount of working capital available to Radka and Atanas.  Currently, they have to wait several weeks to be paid by the large companies after dropping off the shelled nuts.  During this waiting period, they do not have the funds on hand to purchase a new load of walnuts to shell… so they wait instead of work.  With this capital, they’ll be able to dramatically increase the velocity of their business, increasing by 50% – 75% the amount of nuts they can shell in a year.  \r\n\r\nRadka is proud of the work ethic their business has instilled in their children, a laudable trait anywhere and one that is worthy of encouragement.  \r\n\r\nThe Roma, commonly referred to as gypsies, is a severely marginalized social group in the Balkans.  \r\n",,1000,1000,funded,1142,,Food Production/Sales,Food,Working capital,BG,Bulgaria,Sliven,standard,,USD,3,2006-09-18 08:21:24.000 +0000,,2006-10-14 02:25:46.000 +0000,2006-09-30 02:25:46.000 +0000,19,16,4,2,,Radka,female,TRUE,monthly,field_partner

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of “ending poverty”, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance.
